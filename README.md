# Ingredient Analyzer

**Ingredient Analyzer** is a web application that helps users analyze ingredients in food or skincare products by providing information about their potential health effects. The app uses AI, powered by OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4, to identify harmful substances in ingredients and categorize them based on their health impact. The application displays real-time results with color-coded feedback for harmful, moderate, and safe ingredients, helping users make more informed decisions about the products they use.

## Key Features

- **AI-powered Ingredient Analysis**: Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to analyze and identify harmful ingredients based on input.
- **Color-coded Feedback**: Ingredients are categorized as harmful, moderate, or safe, with results displayed using color-coded labels.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Built with Flask, the app features a simple and intuitive user interface using Bootstrap.
- **Real-time Results**: The tool provides instant feedback, offering users detailed explanations about each ingredient.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Loading Indicators**: Shows a loading spinner while the analysis is being processed.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for Python to build the backend.
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Used for analyzing the ingredients and generating responses.
- **Bootstrap**: For creating a responsive and clean user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For handling dynamic interactions such as showing ingredient details.
- **CSS**: For styling the app with a modern look and feel.
- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the web pages.
